		<p class="">
			Founded in 2018 by Jeremiah Bridges and Richard Dolezal, Plumas Disc Golf is a passionate
			non-profit organization dedicated to promoting the sport of disc golf in Plumas County,
			California. Our journey began with the creation of the Pioneer Disc Golf Course in Quincy, a
			project brought to life with the invaluable support of James Shipp, former director of theÂ <a

				target="_blank">Central Plumas Recreation and Parks District</a
			>. Since then, we've been on a mission to expand the reach of disc golf, fostering a vibrant
			community of enthusiasts and newcomers alike. We've hosted over 20 events, including the
			Dynamic Discs Trilogy Challenge each year for the past 3 years, weekly bag tag league, weekly
			ladies league, and beginner clinics. Looking ahead, we're excited to begin work on Cascade
			Disc Golf Course. Join us as we continue to grow the sport of disc golf in Plumas County!
