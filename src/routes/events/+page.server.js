					'<p>Come join us for a fun doubles fundraiser event to support the fight to cure Type 1 Diabetes! &nbsp;This is a casual “bring your own partner” doubles event, where we\'ll be playing best-shot doubles, using a shotgun start. &nbsp;In addition to the doubles round, there will be other games you will be able to participate in, including a Poker Run, Ring of Fire, and an Ace Run Challenge. &nbsp;Each of these extra events will be $3 to enter, but if you want to enter all 3, you\'ll only pay $7 in total. &nbsp;</p><p>Poker Run - as a participant in the Poker Run, you will be given a special scorecard and a card draw upon checking in. &nbsp;During the doubles round, you will also draw a card upon completing holes 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18. &nbsp;This means you will have 7 cards to make your best 5-card hand. &nbsp;Not only that, if you or your partner hit an ace during the round, we\'ll give both of you a Joker!</p><p>Ring of Fire - all participants of the Ring of Fire will stand 20 feet or so from the basket and attempt a putt all at the same time. &nbsp;If you miss, you are eliminated. &nbsp;Those who are not eliminated will repeat until there is only one participant remaining.</p><p>Ace Run Challenge - all participants will play an abbreviated layout of the course, around 6 holes, with shortened teeing areas. &nbsp;Participants will get two shots per tee, in an attempt to hit an ace. &nbsp;An ace grants you 5 points, hitting chains will award 3 points, and you will get 1 point for hitting any other part of the basket with your throws. &nbsp;The player with the highest point total after all the holes will be the winner.</p><p>Awards and Award Ceremony - Each division-winning team and each of our extra event winners will earn prizes, which are to be awarded at the end of the festivities, which we expect to be around 2:30 pm. &nbsp;If we are able to gain enough prize support, we will add prizes for 2nd, 3rd, and so on. &nbsp;If you have something to donate to our prize pool, contact the Tournament Director Dennis Williams at <a href="mailto:myrrden61@gmail.com">myrrden61@gmail.com</a>, or the Assistant Tournament Director Jeremiah Bridges at <a href="mailto:jeremiah@plumasdiscgolf.com">jeremiah@plumasdiscgolf.com</a>. &nbsp;</p><p>We look forward to seeing everybody out there, playing disc golf with old friends and new, supporting this wonderful cause.</p>',
