					bio: 'Rebecca is Venezuelan-American with family in California. She first arrived to the US as a kid to visit family in Quincy and she instantly fell in love with the area, vastly different from her tropical origins! As soon as the opportunity to move to Quincy arose, she took it! She has been part of the Plumas community since 2004 and loves participating in different activities from music, to hiking, to circus arts, to gardening, to disc golf! She started playing disc golf to grieve the passing of her dad, and it quickly turned into a favorite hobby that allows her to get out in nature, hike, explore and exercise! Disc golf has given her a second family of sorts, and being a board director allows her to give back to this family and the community!',

					bio: 'Dennis started playing disc golf back in the early 2000s and started without any help from YouTube or anyone else. Dennis and his son were living in Santa Cruz, so they would go out to the DeLaveaga Disc Golf Course and throw. Back then, he was busy doing construction work and mountain biking. He and his wife Oceanna met and got married in 2014. They thought about moving to Quincy and then made the move in 2016. Sometime around 2021, he remembered liking disc golf. He, his son, and his brother started playing, going out to the forest and throwing at trees. They were out throwing the disc and met Fredrick, who was playing disc golf with many friends. He got to know Fredrick and some of the locals, and eventually joined Plumas Disc Golf. All the people in the community have been great. Heâ€™s super glad he and his wife are here and hopes to see you all out on the course!',
